# make program uses the Makefile description and the last-modification
# times of the files to decide which of the files need to be updated.

# make exits with a status of zero if all makefiles were successfully 
# parsed and no targets that were built failed.
# a status of one will be returned if the -q flag was used and make 
# determines that a target needs to be rebuilt.
# a status of two will be returned if any errors were encountered.
